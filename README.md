# Silver API
API only part of [Silver2](https://github.com/Silver2) that runs on the [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine). This app collects movie schedules daily and makes them available on several REST endpoints.

## Development
Make sure you have at least PHP 5.4 and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

1. Do an initial `composer install` to download dependencies.
2. Use the [Google App Engine Launcher](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads?hl=en) to run the app.
3. Profit!

## Endpoints
TODO: finish endpoints doc

## Notes
This is currently under heavy development and I'm on the process of converting the initial Lumen based app to Slim for a leaner API.
